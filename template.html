                            Process Safety Management (PSM) is a vital tool used in the safety field to provide a systematic approach to preventing the catastrophic release of highly hazardous substances. PSM is a standard set forth by the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT), which the United States of America has adopted (USA)’s Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) since 2017 to prevent unwanted releases of highly hazardous substances into the environment that could expose employees and other to severe hazards.
