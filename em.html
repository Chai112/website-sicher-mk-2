                            Sicher leverages its expansive network of global partners including ADEN group, to lower your facility’s energy
                            footprint, benefitting our environment. We create comprehensive solutions for energy management, on-site renewable
                            energy optimizations, and environmental services to cut carbon and improve efficiency.
                            <br><br>
                            We believe that clean and efficient energy should be available to every business that wants to make a difference. Our
                            energy solutions are designed to be turn-key, meaning that we handle the whole project from design to operation. We can
                            even finance the entire project with our Energy as a Service contract for clients looking to transform energy use.
                            <br><br>
                            In our services, we improve your existing energy-using assets such as chillers, boilers, air compressors, and HVAC or
                            upgrade to a totally new, highly efficient energy station. All energy solutions can digitally link with our AI+IOT
                            platform, giving your unprecedented control and transparency into your energy use.
                            <br><br>
                            Depending on your location, We can design, install and operate the wind turbines and solar panels on-site. With on-site
                            distributed renewable energy, your facility is free from the fossil-fuel-powered grid and can take more control over how
                            and what kind of energy gets used.
                            <br><br>
                            In addition, the energy generated by solar panels can be stored for use on days without sun or wind. The AI platform
                            uses an algorithm to find the ideal balance between power use from on-site sources or the grid, maximizing your savings
                            and environmental impact.

                            Sicher instructors train the Process engineers, maintenances, and EHS team towards increased efficiency and
                            effectiveness in process safety management. The PSM training course is a combination of instructions and team-based
                            exercises and teaches what is at the heart of process safety management.

                        <h1><b>Energy Storage</b></h1>
                        <p>
                            A plug-and-play solution to make sure you’re getting the most from the energy you produce and can support a full range
                            of renewable energy technologies – EV, wind and solar. Energy storage allows you to use the clean energy you generate
                            whenever you need it.
                        </p>
                        <h1><b>EV Charging</b></h1>
                        <p>
                            Installing EV chargers adds value to your property and demonstrates your commitment to a better environment. There’s
                            even the potential to generate revenue through sales of EV charging to third party users or tap into subsidies as
                            governments look to subsidize consumer EVs and electrify their own public transit vehicles.<br>
                        </p>
                        <h1><b>Wind</b></h1>
                        <p>
                            Build turbines on your site to generate massive amounts of clean energy, powering thousands of operating hours per year.
                            All you need is 400 sq. m of free space for construction and even less when operational. You’ll see a drastic drop in
                            your energy spending and cut tens of thousands of tons of CO2.
