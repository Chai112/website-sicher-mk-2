                        <h4>
                            Process Safety Management (PSM) is a vital tool used in the safety field to provide a systematic approach in preventing
                            catastrophic releases of highly hazardous substances. PSM is a standard set forth by the Industrial Estate Authority of
                            Thailand (IEAT), which the United States of America’s Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) has adopted
                            since 2017. By preventing release of substances, it will benefit the environment and reduce employee’s exposure to
                            severe health hazards.
